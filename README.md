# Project description 

This data analysis project is done on PISA 2018 data on Thai students' education achievement during my internship at Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) from late Dec 2019 to early Jan 2020.

# Background

Thai students are not doing well academically. According to the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/thailand/publication/wanted---a-quality-education-for-all-in-thailand), a significant proportion of 15-year-old Thai students are functionally illiterate, especially those in the rural areas. Some researchers  have attributed Thailand's lagging performance in education to its overemphasis on [rote memorisation](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/overview/learning-curve-despite-premium-placed-learning-sector-has-struggled-show-positive-results-0), [shortage of education staff](http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/secondary-teachers-in-thailand-secondary-teacher-policy-research-in-asia-2011-en.pdf), and so on. Because there are many stakeholders in any education system (e.g. policymakers, teachers, students, parents, etc.), it is difficult to attribute what causes the successes or failures of the system. The problem with Thai education is exacerbated by [Thailand's lack of data availability](https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1219025/open-data-policy-the-key-to-success): the absence of data makes it difficult for policymakers to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of their policies. 

# Project's goal 
To empircally understand factors affecting Thai students' education performance. 

# Why use PISA 2018 data? 

First, PISA is one of the few open-source empirical data about Thai students' education achievement.  <br />
Second, PISA collects a detailed information on each student, be it their parents' background, socioeconomic status, school condition, class size, and so on. The richness of PISA dataset allows researchers to analyze the relationship between education performance and factors that may influence it.  <br />
Third, unlike those in previous years, participants in PISA 2018 were asked to answer questionnaire on their attitudes towards education (e.g. growth mindset, expected highest level of education) and their emotion state. Because the impact of mindset on education has received a lot of attention from researchers on Thai education (e.g. [Tayjasanant et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311605841_Thai_EFL_teachers_and_learners'_beliefs_and_readiness_for_autonomous_learning)), PISA 2018 data on each student's attitude may contribute to the conversation. 

# Work process

1.) I loaded the data from PISA website on the education achievement of Thai students in 2018. <br /> 

2.) I skimmed through PISA methodology (e.g. how the test was administered, how PISA imputes missing data) and the codebook on what each column stands for to understand the format of the data and how to analyze them. 

3.) I researched previous literatures on PISA results. These literatures included [the PISA 2018 executive summary](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/PISA%202018%20Insights%20and%20Interpretations%20FINAL%20PDF.pdf), [PISA's comparison of Thailand and other countries](http://www.compareyourcountry.org/pisa/country/THA), and papers about Thai education that analyze PISA data. The excerpt on each paper is as provided below:

Moreover, I discussed current education initiatives at TDRI with my colleagues and my research supervisor at the institution to identify how PISA 2018 data might inform those initiatives.

# About the author
This project is done by Peem Lerdputtipongporn, Swarthmore College Class of 2021. As a Mathematics and Computer Science major, Peem is interested in using statistics and computation to make a positive impact to society. His area of interest includes education, economic development, and finance. For Summer 2020, he is looking for an internship/fellowship in Data Science for Social Good. 

# Acknowledgement
I undertook this project during my internship at Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI). I wish to extend my gratitude to my colleagues at TDRI who provided me with guidance and emotional support, both of which play a crucial role in the completion of this project.
