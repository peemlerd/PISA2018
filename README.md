# Project description 

This data analysis project is done on PISA 2018 data on Thai students' education achievement during my internship at Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) from late Dec 2019 to early Jan 2020.

# Background

Thai students are not doing well academically. According to the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/thailand/publication/wanted---a-quality-education-for-all-in-thailand), a significant proportion of 15-year-old Thai students are functionally illiterate, especially those in the rural areas. Some researchers  have attributed Thailand's lagging performance in education to its overemphasis on [rote memorisation](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/overview/learning-curve-despite-premium-placed-learning-sector-has-struggled-show-positive-results-0), [shortage of education staff](http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/secondary-teachers-in-thailand-secondary-teacher-policy-research-in-asia-2011-en.pdf), and so on. Because there are many stakeholders in any education system (e.g. policymakers, teachers, students, parents, etc.), it is difficult to attribute what causes the successes or failures of the system. The problem with Thai education is exacerbated by [Thailand's lack of data availability](https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1219025/open-data-policy-the-key-to-success): the absence of data makes it difficult for policymakers to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of their policies. 

# Goal 
To empirically study 
In this project, I will approach the question of what works in Thai schools and what not from an empirical perspective using PISA 2018 data on Thai students' education achievement.
