    "Methodology: \n",
    "First, I loaded the PISA 2018 data on Thai students' education achievement. Because people have previously studied \n",
    "the impact of students' socioeconomic background on their education achievement, I decided to focus on questions\n",
    "pertaining to students' attitude towards education (referring to P.47-P.60 of the student questionnaire). \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I looked at the data and observed that virtually every question is on an Agree/Disagree scale except for \n",
    "their expected education achievement. After looking at the expected education level, I concluded that the data \n",
    "was not properly filled since it added up to more than 8600 (the total number of students participating in this\n",
    "study). Therefore, I decided to remove it for the regression analysis. Moreover, we experienced several problems\n",
    "with No Response, so we filter out every student whose responses miss at least 2 spots. Not much data is missed \n",
    "given that only 227 out of 8700 students have at least 2 spots missed; for others, their data is complete or \n",
    "misses only one spot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, I converted the Agree/Disagree questionnaire into 1-4 scale and ran multiple linear regression. The result\n",
    "will be shown above. Only the variables with p-value less than 0.05 will be shown. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, group the variables by positive/negative coefficient and pick only the strongest coefficients. \n",
    "That is, pick variables that have high explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitation: Reverse causality (e.g. Dumbness may cause fixed mindset. )\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea: Check the interaction between socioeconomic background and A) Economic B) Growth Mindset. Will do so soon. \n",

    "# Theme 1: External motivation. Students are motivated by values in more immediate future in which they have more \n",

    "# Theme 2: Healthy concern correlate with high education performance. Factors such as life contentment, satisfaction,\n",
    "# and life meaning negatively correlate with education performance. \n",
    "# Theme 3: Emotion state. Concerned and happy/joyous/content students are top-performers. \n",
    "# Theme 4: Growth mindset. Predicts strong performance. \n",
    "# Overall: Healthy concern (i.e. not too complacent) + growth mindset + external motivation + happy emotion state. "
