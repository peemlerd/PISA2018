# Project description 

This data analysis project is done on PISA 2018 data on Thai students' education achievement during my internship at Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) from late Dec 2019 to early Jan 2020.

# Background

Thai students are not doing well academically. According to the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/thailand/publication/wanted---a-quality-education-for-all-in-thailand), a significant proportion of 15-year-old Thai students are functionally illiterate, especially those in the rural areas. Some researchers  have attributed Thailand's lagging performance in education to its overemphasis on [rote memorisation](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/overview/learning-curve-despite-premium-placed-learning-sector-has-struggled-show-positive-results-0), [shortage of education staff](http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/secondary-teachers-in-thailand-secondary-teacher-policy-research-in-asia-2011-en.pdf), and so on. Because there are many stakeholders in any education system (e.g. policymakers, teachers, students, parents, etc.), it is difficult to attribute what causes the successes or failures of the system. The problem with Thai education is exacerbated by [Thailand's lack of data availability](https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1219025/open-data-policy-the-key-to-success): the absence of data makes it difficult for policymakers to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of their policies. 

# Project's goal 
To study what works in Thai schools using an empirical data. 

# Why PISA 2018 data? 

1.) PISA is one of the few open-source empirical data about Thai students' education achievement. 
2.) PISA collects a detailed information on each student, be it their parents' background, socioeconomic status, school condition, class size, and so on. The richness of PISA dataset allows researchers to analyze the relationship between education performance and factors that may influence it. 
3.) Unlike those in previous years, participants in PISA 2018 were asked to answer questionnaire on their attitudes towards education (e.g. growth mindset, expected highest level of education) and their emotion state. Because the impact of mindset on education has received a lot of attention from researchers on Thai education (e.g. [Tayjasanant et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311605841_Thai_EFL_teachers_and_learners'_beliefs_and_readiness_for_autonomous_learning)), PISA 2018 data on each student's attitude may contribute to the conversation.
